this is where song charts go

the folders should look something like this
-----------------------------------
"song-name-with-spaces"
"thisisareallyhardsong"
"songname"
-----------------------------------
There should be no capital letters and the spaces should be replaced with dashes

the charts go inside the folders.

you should not need to open the json files, unless you want to edit something without opening the game.
