this is where songs go

the folders should look something like this
-----------------------------------
"song-name-with-spaces"
"thisisareallyhardsong"
"songname"
-----------------------------------
There should be no capital letters and the spaces should be replaced with dashes

the song files go inside the folders

there should be a file named "Inst.ogg" and a file named "Voices.ogg", if there is no Voices.ogg file, simply put the Inst.ogg file in the folder, go to data and turn off "needsVoices" (set it to false)
