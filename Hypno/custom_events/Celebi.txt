put in a value 1, if health - that value is less (if equal, 
no dice) then 0, the player dies. Half health is 1, if you
wanna cut the life bar in health, do like 1.001 or smthn.

Place on every tile you want it to be active on, just make
a section full of the event and only it and copy and paste
it to every section it affects.
